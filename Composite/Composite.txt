Store the reference of the child to the parent/child maybe simplify the traversal of the composite structure

This DP may hurt Interface Segregation Principle of solid, because the Composite may have operations that for Leaf class isn't meaningful.
One way to solve this, in case of a Leaf not having a child, so not being necessary to have a Child method, is to create a class Glyph implementing a default operation of not returning nothing when is a leaf component.
This is why I started with the IGlyph interface, but then I prefered to create a class, so I could implement default implementations.

Setar Parent no RowComposite!
